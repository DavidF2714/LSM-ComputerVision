# Mexican Sign Language Recognition using Computer Vision
This project aims to develop a computer vision model to recognize and analyze Mexican Sign Language (Lengua de Se√±as Mexicana, LSM). By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to create an efficient and accurate system that can interpret LSM gestures in real-time, enhancing communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## Features
Gesture Recognition: Identify and classify various signs from LSM using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Real-Time Analysis: Implement real-time recognition capabilities using webcam input.
Dataset Utilization: Utilize publicly available datasets of LSM signs or create a custom dataset through video recordings.
User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive interface that displays recognized signs and their meanings.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
